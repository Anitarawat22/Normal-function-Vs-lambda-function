Normal Function In PYTHON

def my_sum(x,y):
    return x+y
total = my_sum(5,9)
print(total)


my_list = [5,7,8,2,5,9]
def doubler(x):
    return 2*x
output = list(map(doubler,my_list))


LAMBDA FUNCTION:In PYTHON -----> A lambda function is an anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but,
unlike normal functions, evaluates and returns only one expression.

from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x,y : x+y,my_list)

MAP AND REDUCE ARE THE HIGHER ORDEF FUNCTION  .Higher order function is the one which takes as input another function or which gives as output another function.
